This example analysis folder uses a subset of the RPPA data from Hill et al. 2017 (PubMed ID: 28017544). Here we compare MCF7 breast cancer cell line induced with the protein ligand IGF1 to the same cell line treated with DMSO control. The experiment has readings at 9 time points for both test and control cases. We compare them using a paired t-test.

This analysis folder can be directly uploaded to CausalPath webserver by selecting the option "Load input files for analysis" and then selecting this JAR file.
